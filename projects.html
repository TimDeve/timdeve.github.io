      <p>codeAlong is a community to share snippet of code, people can comment on each other snippet, star their favourite and even recode a snippet to put their own twist on it. The goal of the project was to create a full stack Rails app. My reason for building this app was that I wanted to create a piece of software that would not only be interesting in the quality of it’s code but also in its potential usefulness for me and my classmate. The main things I learned from that project was how to organise a growing codebase and complex database relationship.</p>
