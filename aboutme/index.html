  <p>I am a French Web Developer who calls London home. I enjoy a good debate be it about computing, gaming, books or languages. I love losing myself in an activity whether it’s wreck diving, a coding challenge or a good book.  I moved to London because it feels like it’s the centre of the world; the diversity of people and ideas means there is always something to learn.</p>
  <p>Do you work with JavaScript/Node, Go, Functional Programming, or some new cutting edge technology? If so, let’s get a coffee!</p>
